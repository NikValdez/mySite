"Seventeen, seventeen rat tails".

 A portly, bureaucratic looking man, reached over his desk and handed Giang his take for the week. At one cent a tail, Giang, a slender boy of 11, would be covering much of the family's expenses for the month.

Let's rewind...

The year was 1902, the place, Hanoi, the capital in what is now modern-day Vietnam. French colonial powers ruled the day and had taken aim at transforming Indochina into their very own Euro-Asia.

The man in charge of the operation was Paul Doumer, a failed government official who had been sent to Hanoi, after an incompetent stint as France's minister of finance. Soon after arriving in Hanoi, Paul was struck by a sudden bout of inspiration. What could be more civilized and Parisian than an advanced sewer system running through the French quarter of the city? Voila!, he likely exclaimed.

Not Voila Paul, not Voila at all.

Soon after the completion of the Governor-General's magnum opus, it was brought to his attention there was a slight issue with the sewers. Astonishingly, creating dark, damp, superhighways, safe from all predation created ideal conditions for rats to propagate in large numbers. Rodent coitus was running rampant and Monsieur Doumer was at a loss for what to do.

Not eager to repeat his past failures, being that the guillotine was still in vogue, Paul had to think and think fast.

Later that same night, over a few glasses of an earthy Bordeaux and well into his cups at that point, a "brilliant" idea popped into his head üí°. "A bounty, we'll do a bounty". Over the next few days, word was spread that a rat bounty was in place. One cent per rat, not a bad pull for the average Vietnamese at the time.

But all those carouses would stack up in the government buildings Paul thought. So instead of bringing in the full rat, the mere tail would suffice.

Now Back to Giang.

Leaving the government building, Giang had on a grin so big he almost split his face in two. In the three weeks of the bounty program, this was by far his largest score. Arriving home, he made a B-line for the back yard where he had set up what could accurately be characterized as a rat brothel.

See, like most Hanoian's, Giang had figured out a simple Darwinian truth, An amputee rat who procreates will produce offspring with their appendages fully intact. Appendages, which in turn can be chopped off and turned in to the tune of one cent each.

It didn't take long for the people of Hanoi to realize it was more profitable, and sustainable, to cut the tails off live rats and release them to breed. Soon the city was overrun with vermin and poor Paul Doumer was forced to eat a colossal plate of crow.

What does a semi-apocryphal tale about tailless rats have to do with incentives?

Incentives drive behavior. When we fail to view events and make decisions through this lens. Issues arise and preventable mistakes are made.

Yet an argument is not made on a single rat tale. So let's examine a few more.

During colonial rule in India, the number of venomous cobras became of concern to the British.

Sound Familiar.

You remember that little rat issue they had in Vietnam? You know the one, we just talked about it. Well, replace Rats for Cobras and the French for the British and you get near identical results. Colonial rulers sure aren't showing well in this essay.

Moaist China -- A series of misaligned incentives led to the deaths of more than 45 million, many starved despite the country exporting large amounts of grain to meet quotas set forth from above. People melted pots and pans in their backyard to meet the steel production quotas even when they would have nothing to cook with. Stories like this were rampant despite millions dying.

Cold War Soviet Union -- Set production goals in tons, leading to the overuse of steal and overproduction of the heaviest possible items. They decimated the whales, killing 180,000 in short order, despite not having much use for them.

One issue with tyrannical dictators (believe it or not, there's more than one), is they don't love constructive criticism, they tend not to take to it so well, with the jailing and the murdering and all. Because of this, bad news coming from below often isn't shared up the chain of command. Historically, this has led to their demise. It happened to Hitler in WWII, as his generals would often obfuscate the dire circumstances the German's were in to avoid the Fuhrer's wrath. The same can be said for both Stalin and Mao.

Communism... just the whole thing.

Looking for something a bit more recent?

How about the Well's Fargo debacle from a few years back. Much of employee compensation was tied to sales targets. Employees responded in turn by opening millions of phony bank accounts and credit cards in the names of unwitting customers, costing them millions in fees. When the totality of the charade was revealed, the bank was fined a cool three billion, and the banks' reputation in disarray.

Economist <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/" target="_blank">Tyler Cowen</a> has pointed out that when one of Silicon Valley's tech darlings goes public there is a wave of divorces. Non-liquid assets, like equity in a private company, can be hard to split up, therefore couples are incentivized to stay together until the companies IPO. 

Putting up with Benjamin's "fun" little quirks, like clipping his nails in the marital bed, seemed much less enticing once Olivia realized she would be taking home half that cash.

But incentives aren't only economic.  <a href="https://russroberts.info/" target="_blank">Russ Roberts</a>, the host of Econ Talk, is fond of the Adam Smith quote,

‚ÄúMan naturally desires, not only to be loved, but to be lovely.‚Äù

Not only do we strive to be loved by others, but we aspire to be the type of people deserving of such love. virtuous people. To Smith, this meant cultivating "prudence, justice, and beneficence", but to others, it might mean something different. We are incentivized by the things we desire, be it money, sex, power, fame, love or whatever butters your biscuit.

Taking the time to think through the incentives involved when decision making pays future dividends. Failing to do so, will have your city overrun with free-loving rats and venomous cobras and I'm not telling any tales out of school when I say nobody wants that.

I'll leave you with a final equation,

Good intentions * Bad Incentives = Bad outcomes
